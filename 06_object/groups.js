 * 
 * Groups
 * The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure called Set. Like an instance of
 * Map, a set holds a collection of values. Unlike Map, it does not associate other values with those—it
 * just tracks which values are part of the set. A value can be part of a set only once—adding it again
 * doesn’t have any effect.
 * 
 * Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods.
 * Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds a value to the group (but only if it isn’t already a
 * member), delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean
 * value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.
 * 
 * Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, to determine whether two values are the
 * same.
 * 
 * Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as argument and creates a group that
 * contains all the values produced by iterating over it.
