 * 
 * A list
 * Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of data structures. A common
 * data structure is the list (not to be confused with array). A list is a nested set of objects, with
 * the first object holding a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on.
 * 
 * let list = {
 *  value: 1,
 *  rest: {
 *   value: 2,
 *   rest: {
 *    value: 3,
 *     rest: null
 *   }
 *  }
 * };
 * 
 * A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure. For example, if I create
 * two new values {value: 0, rest: list} and {value: -1, rest: list} (with list referring to the binding
 * defined earlier), they are both independent lists, but they share the structure that makes up their
 * last three elements. The original list is also still a valid three-element list.
 *
 * Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one shown when given [1, 2, 3]
 * as argument. Also write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. Then add a helper
 * function prepend, which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to
 * the front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the element at the
 * given position in the list (with zero referring to the first element) or undefined when there is no
 * such element.
 *
 * If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth.
